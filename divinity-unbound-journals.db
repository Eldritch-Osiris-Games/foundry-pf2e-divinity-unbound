However, a creature that gains the attention of the divine must take their attitude into account. For each step away from Indifferent a deity’s attitude towards a creature is, any attempts at performing a Deific Obedience for that deity gain a circumstance bonus or penalty. If the deity’s attitude is Friendly, that creature gains a +1 bonus, and if the deity is Helpful it gains a +3 bonus.

The DC for this flat check is 16, modified by the current attitude the deity has towards that creature. If the deity’s attitude is Friendly, the DC is Easy, and if the deity is Helpful the DC is Very Easy. The DCs become Hard or Very Hard for Unfriendly or Hostile attitudes.
